 * Authorization model (see ADR-012, docs/architecture/authorization.md).

 * This is NOT a single PersonRole aggregate. Authorization is derived from
 * scoped memberships and assignments, not permanent global person roles.
 * See docs/architecture/person-role-model.md for the full model.
 *
 * The types below define the separate concepts:
 *   - PlatformRole      (platform-level administrative capabilities)
 *   - OrganizationMembership (a Person belongs to an Organization)
 *   - OrganizationRoleAssignment (a Person holds a role within an org)
 *   - TeamMembership     (a Person/AthleteProfile is on a Team)
 *   - EventAssignment    (a Person is assigned to an Event in a capacity)
 *   - Permission         (a scoped capability string)
 *   - PermissionScope    (the scope at which a permission is evaluated)
