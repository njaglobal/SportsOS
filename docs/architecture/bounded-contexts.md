# Bounded Contexts

> SportsOS is decomposed into bounded contexts aligned to the product vision.
> Each context owns its aggregates, value objects, and domain events.
>
> **[C] Sprint 0.1 correction:** Contexts do NOT communicate only through
> EventBus. Cross-context interaction may use published application contracts,
> synchronous query/service ports, domain/integration events, and immutable
> shared identifiers. See `dependency-rules.md`, ADR-017.

Arrows denote "collaborates with." Contexts may interact via events
(asynchronous) or synchronous query/service ports, chosen per consistency
requirement. No context imports another context's domain internals directly.

## Contexts

### 1. Identity & Sports ID

**Owns:** `Person`, `SportsId`, `AthleteProfile`, minor/guardian relationship,
identity lifecycle (active/deactivated/archived/anonymized).
**Ownership classification [C]:** Person and SportsId are platform-global.
AthleteProfile is person-owned.
**Responsibility:** the permanent, platform-issued identity that survives
account lifecycle changes. Issues Sports IDs. Manages AthleteProfile creation
(optional, at most one per Person). Never deletes a Person's historical
identity. See `identity-model.md`, ADR-002, ADR-010, ADR-011.

### 2. Memberships & Authorization

**Owns:** `PlatformRoleAssignment`, `OrganizationMembership`,
`OrganizationRoleAssignment`, `TeamMembership`, `EventAssignment`,
`GuardianRelationship`, `Permission`, `PermissionScope`.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Memberships/assignments are organization/tenant-owned
or event-scoped. Platform role assignments are platform-global.
**Responsibility:** manages scoped memberships and assignments, derives
permissions, evaluates `can(person, permission, scope)`. Permission-based,
not role-name based. See `person-role-model.md`, `authorization.md`, ADR-012.

### 3. Sports Catalog

**Owns:** `Sport`, `Discipline`, `CompetitionMeasure`.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Reference data (platform-global, no tenantId).
**Responsibility:** the canonical catalog of sports, disciplines, and how they
are measured/scored. Reference data; slow-changing. A future controlled
customization model may allow tenant-specific extensions. See `sports-model.md`,
ADR-010.

### 4. Organizations & Tenancy

**Owns:** `Tenant`, `Organization`, `Team`.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Organization/tenant-owned.
**Responsibility:** the isolation boundary (Tenant) and the structured bodies
(clubs, schools, associations, LGUs, governing bodies, sponsors, venue
operators). Teams are competing units that belong to organizations. See
`organization-model.md`, `tenancy.md`, ADR-004, ADR-010.

### 5. Competition & Events

**Owns:** `CompetitionEvent`, `Competition`, `Division`, `Stage`, `Contest`
(future), `EventFormat`, participant abstraction.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Event-scoped (tenant-owned).
**Responsibility:** defining and running competitions across all formats.
Independent aggregate lifecycles at each level (Event → Competition →
Division → Stage → Contest) to avoid unbounded aggregates at national scale.
See `competition-model.md`, ADR-005, ADR-013.

### 6. Registration & Eligibility

**Owns:** `Registration`, eligibility rules, check-in (future).
**Ownership classification [C]:** Event-scoped (tenant-owned).
**Responsibility:** entering a participant into an event, verifying
eligibility, and separating the **participant** from the **payer**. See
`registration-model.md`, ADR-008.

### 7. Commerce / Payments

**Owns:** `RegistrationCharge`, `Order`, `PaymentAttempt`,
`PaymentTransaction`, `Refund`, `Settlement`, `OrganizerPayout`, `Money`.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Organization/tenant-owned + historical/audit.
**Responsibility:** money movement, append-only financial records,
multi-currency. Multiple payment attempts per order. Decoupled from
registration domain logic via events and/or synchronous service ports. See
`commerce-model.md`, ADR-008, ADR-014.

### 8. Results & Achievements

**Owns:** `CompetitionResult`, `Achievement`, result immutability.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Historical/audit.
**Responsibility:** recording confirmed competition outcomes and deriving
verifiable achievements. Append-only; amendments never overwrite. References
`AthleteProfile` (person-owned) and `Competition` (event-scoped). See
`results-achievements-model.md`.

### 9. Rewards Ledger

**Owns:** `RewardsLedgerEntry`, derived `RewardsBalance`,
`RewardSourceIdentity`, verification/fraud controls.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Historical/audit.
**Responsibility:** Sports Points accounting. The ledger is the source of
truth; balances are projections. Idempotent issuance, reversal/adjustment
entries, duplicate-award prevention. See `rewards-model.md`, ADR-006, ADR-015.

### 10. QR Credentials & Verification

**Owns:** `QrCredential`, `IdentityVerification`.
**Ownership classification [C]:** Permanent QR credentials are person-owned;
event credentials are event-scoped (tenant-owned). IdentityVerification is
person-owned.
**Responsibility:** issuing, rotating, and revoking QR credentials with full
lifecycle (issued/active/expired/revoked/replaced/compromised), and tracking
identity verification levels. SportsId and QrCredential are separate. See
`qr-credentials-model.md`, ADR-007.

## [C] Cross-context communication

Contexts do NOT directly depend on another context's repositories or domain
internals. They may interact via:

1. **Published application contracts** — well-defined interfaces (query/service
   ports) owned by the application layer, allowing one context to query
   another for read-only data when synchronous consistency is needed.
2. **Synchronous query/service ports** — for when the caller needs an
   immediate consistent answer (e.g. Registration querying Commerce for an
   Order's payment status).
3. **Domain/integration events** — for asynchronous, eventual-consistency
   communication (e.g. `ResultConfirmed` → Rewards considers issuance).
4. **Immutable shared identifiers** — typed IDs from the shared kernel
   (`Id<"Person">`, `Id<"Event">`, etc.). Contexts reference each other by ID,
   never by importing another context's aggregate state.

**Synchronous vs asynchronous** is chosen per consistency requirement:
synchronous when the caller needs an immediate consistent answer, asynchronous
when eventual consistency is acceptable. See `dependency-rules.md`, ADR-017.
