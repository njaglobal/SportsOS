# Architecture Rules

> Mandatory architectural principles and invariants for SportsOS.
> Each rule is numbered to match the sprint brief and is normative: a PR that
> violates a rule must not be merged without an ADR superseding it.
>
> **Sprint 0.1 corrections** are marked with [C]. See ADRs 010–017 for the
> correction rationale.

## R1. One Person may hold many platform roles.

A `Person` is the natural/legal identity. Roles are derived from scoped
memberships and assignments (`OrganizationMembership`, `OrganizationRoleAssignment`,
`TeamMembership`, `EventAssignment`, `PlatformRoleAssignment`), not a single
flat `PersonRole` aggregate. A Person may hold several roles simultaneously,
in different scopes. See `person-role-model.md`, `authorization.md`, ADR-012.

## R2. One Person has at most one Sports ID.

The Sports ID is a permanent, platform-issued identifier. It is issued once
and never reissued to a different person. The Sports ID is **platform-global
identity** [C], not tenant/organization-owned. See `identity-model.md`,
`tenancy.md`, ADR-002, ADR-010.

## R3. [C] A Person MAY have at most one AthleteProfile. A Person does not automatically become an athlete.

An `AthleteProfile` is an optional sport-independent sporting identity
projection. A Person may exist only as a coach, guardian, official, organizer,
staff member, sponsor representative, etc., with no AthleteProfile. When an
AthleteProfile exists, it is sport-independent. See ADR-003, ADR-010,
`identity-model.md`.

## R4. AthleteProfile ↔ Sport is many-to-many.

`AthleteSportParticipation` links an AthleteProfile to many Sports (and
Disciplines), and a Sport to many AthleteProfiles. A single athlete may
participate in and win across multiple sports throughout their lifetime.

## R5. Historical competition records must be auditable and protected from destructive mutation.

`CompetitionResult` entries are append-only. Corrections produce a new entry
with `status: "amended"` referencing the prior entry; the original is never
overwritten or deleted. See `results-achievements-model.md`,
`audit-integrity.md`.

## R6. Achievements/championships are separate from spendable rewards.

`Achievement` (champion, medalist, record holder) is a verifiable historical
record. `RewardsLedgerEntry` (Sports Points) is a spendable accounting entry.
Issuing an achievement does not issue points, and vice versa. See ADR-006.

## R7. Sports Points must use an append-oriented ledger as source of truth.

`RewardsLedgerEntry` is the source of truth. `RewardsBalance` is a **derived
projection**, never authoritative and never mutated directly. See ADR-006.

## R8. QR credentials identify a person but must not contain sensitive profile data.

A `QrCredential` carries only an opaque `payloadToken` that resolves to the
person server-side. It must not embed name, DOB, contact, or health data.
See ADR-007.

## R9. Permanent Sports ID QR and temporary/dynamic event credentials are separate concepts.

`QrCredentialKind` discriminates `permanent_sports_id` (long-lived, person-scoped)
from `event_credential` (short-lived, event-scoped, rotatable). See
`qr-credentials-model.md`. SportsId and QrCredential are separate concepts
[C] — rotating/revoking a credential never changes the Person's SportsId.

## R10. QR identity, biometric/device authentication, and identity verification are separate concepts.

- QR identity = "which person does this credential point to"
- Biometric/device auth = "is this device unlocked by its owner"
- Identity verification = "has this person been verified (self / document / verified)"

These are independent and compose; none implies another. See
`qr-credentials-model.md`.

## R11. Competition architecture must support team, individual, timed, measured, and multi-participant events.

Competitions carry a `format` and a `participantKind` (individual | team). The
`measure` field drives scoring semantics. Formats are extensible without
schema change. See ADR-005, ADR-013, `competition-model.md`.

## R12. Geography must not hard-code Philippine administrative structures.

Geography uses a generic, typed-place model with a country code (ISO 3166-1)
and an ordered list of named administrative levels. No `barangay`/`municipality`
columns. See `geography-localization.md`.

## R13. Currency must not hard-code PHP.

`Money` carries an ISO 4217 `currency` code. Amounts are integer minor units.
See `commerce-model.md`.

## R14. [C] Multi-tenancy and organization isolation must be explicit, but NOT every entity is tenant-owned.

Entities are classified by ownership (see `tenancy.md`, ADR-010):
**platform-global**, **reference data**, **person-owned**,
**organization/tenant-owned**, **event-scoped**, **historical/audit**. Only
organization/tenant-owned and event-scoped entities carry `tenantId`.
Platform-global entities (Person, SportsId, Sport, Discipline) and
person-owned entities (AthleteProfile) do NOT carry `tenantId`. Cross-tenant
access to tenant-owned data is never implicit.

## R15. Authorization must be permission-based, not hard-coded role checks.

Authorization evaluates `Permission` values against scopes derived from
memberships/assignments [C]. Code must not branch on role names
(`if role === 'organizer'`). Permissions derive from scoped
`OrganizationMembership`, `TeamMembership`, `EventAssignment`, and
`PlatformRoleAssignment`, not from permanent global person roles. See
`authorization.md`, ADR-012.

## R16. Financial operations must be auditable.

Every charge, refund, settlement, and adjustment produces append-only records
(`PaymentTransaction`, `Refund`, `Settlement`). The financial ledger is
append-only [C]. See `commerce-model.md`, `audit-integrity.md`, ADR-014.

## R17. Reward issuance must support fraud controls and event verification.

`RewardsLedgerEntry` carries `verified` and `verificationRef`. Issuance for an
event result must be verified before the balance projection counts it as
available. Issuance is idempotent [C] — `idempotencyKey`, `sourceIdentity`,
`earningRuleId`/`earningRuleVersion` prevent duplicate awards. Corrected
results use reversal/adjustment entries, never edits to original entries. See
`rewards-model.md`, ADR-015.

## R18. Registration participant and payment payer must be separate concepts.

A `Registration` has a `participantId` (AthleteProfile or Team) and a separate
`payerPersonId`. A guardian may pay for a minor athlete. See
`registration-model.md`, ADR-008.

## R19. Minors/guardian relationships must be supportable.

A `Person` may have a `guardianId` pointing to another `Person`. Guardian
consent flows are modeled on this relationship. The architecture explicitly
considers minors in retention/privacy [C]. See `identity-model.md`,
`audit-integrity.md`, ADR-011.

## R20. [C] Historical sports records must not disappear because an account/entity is deleted — but blanket "soft delete only" is replaced by a layered retention model.

Retention is separated into: account closure, Person deactivation, identity
archival, legal/business retention, anonymization/pseudonymization, historical
competition preservation, and audit/financial retention. Historical
sporting/financial records may be preserved without retaining unnecessary
personal data indefinitely. See `audit-integrity.md`, ADR-011.

## R21. Domain/application logic must be reusable across web and future Android/iOS delivery.

Domain and application layers have zero imports from browser, React, React
Native, Supabase, Stripe, or any platform SDK. See `dependency-rules.md`,
ADR-009.

## R22. Native/platform APIs must remain behind adapters.

Camera, QR scanner, push, secure storage, biometrics, file upload, deep links,
sharing, location, offline sync — all are ports in `src/ports/native-ports.ts`,
implemented by adapters per platform. Native platform ports are owned by the
application layer, NOT the domain [C]. See `client-platforms.md`,
`mobile-strategy.md`, ADR-016.

## R23. Architecture must allow future limited offline workflows for event operations without implementing them now.

The `OfflineSyncPort` and queued-operation model exist to support future
offline event check-in and scoring. No offline implementation is built this
sprint. See `offline-resilience.md`.

## R24. Infrastructure may later be replaced without rewriting core business logic.

Ports are owned by the application layer [C]. Adapters implement them.
Swapping Supabase for another Postgres provider, or Stripe for another
processor, requires only a new adapter. See `dependency-rules.md`, ADR-016.

## R25. [C] Domain must not depend on native/browser/infrastructure ports.

The domain layer contains business model and invariants only. It must NOT
import from `@ports` or any infrastructure/native capability. Application
owns orchestration and required external capability contracts. Repository,
EventBus, Clock, and IdGenerator are application-owned ports. See
`dependency-rules.md`, ADR-016.

## R26. [C] Cross-context interaction is not limited to EventBus.

Bounded-context domain internals must not directly depend on another context's
repositories or domain internals. Cross-context interaction may use: published
application contracts, synchronous query/service ports, domain/integration
events, and immutable shared identifiers. Synchronous vs asynchronous is
chosen per consistency requirement. See `dependency-rules.md`, ADR-017.

## R27. [S1] TeamMembership is team/organization-scoped; event participation is a separate concept.

`TeamMembership` records that a Person belongs to a Team within an Organization
(a tenant isolation boundary). It is **not** event-scoped. Participation in a
specific event is represented by a future `EventRosterEntry` / `CompetitionEntry`
concept (added with a competition vertical slice), which references the event,
the competition/division, and the participant. This keeps standing team
membership independent of per-event rosters. See `person-role-model.md`.

## R28. [S1] `tenantId` denotes an isolation boundary, not a generic association.

A `tenantId` on an entity means that entity lives **inside** a tenant's
isolation boundary and is subject to that tenant's access control. It is not a
convenience foreign key for "an organization is involved." Historical/audit
records may retain origin references (e.g. the organizing `tenantId` a result
was produced under) without becoming mutable tenant-owned records. See
`tenancy.md`, ADR-010.

## R29. [S1] Aggregate-root status is decided by invariants and lifecycle, not by having an ID.

A concept is an aggregate root because it owns a transactional consistency
boundary and an independent lifecycle — not merely because it has an identifier.
Conceptual entities are not automatically aggregate roots; candidate boundaries
are validated through vertical slices, not fixed up front. See ADR-013.

## R30. [S1] Repositories are use-case/context-specific, not a generic CRUD abstraction.

The application layer defines **no** generic `Repository<T>` interface. Each
bounded context / use-case declares the persistence contract it actually needs
when a slice requires it, so aggregates are not forced into identical CRUD
semantics. See `application-foundation.md`, ADR-016, ADR-018.

## Enforcement

- **TypeScript path aliases** keep layers navigable (`@domain`, `@app`, `@ports`,
  `@adapters`, `@composition`, `@shared`).
- **`dependency-cruiser`** [S1] machine-enforces all layer and context-isolation
  rules. Run independently with `npm run architecture:check`; the same ruleset
  is asserted in `tests/architecture.test.ts`. See `dependency-rules.md` and
  ADR-018. Runtime cross-context domain imports fail the check; type-only
  references are permitted.
- **ESLint `import/no-cycle`** is a secondary guard against circular dependencies.
- **Code review** remains a backstop but is no longer the primary boundary
  mechanism.
